# HTTP Methods and Status Codes

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is a protocol that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted and how web servers and browsers should respond to different commands.

In HTTP, there are several methods (also known as verbs) that describe the action to be performed on the given resource. These methods are used to indicate the desired operation when making requests to a web server.

## Common HTTP Methods

1. **GET**
    - The `GET` method is used to request data from a specified resource.
    - It is typically used for fetching information or data from a server.
    - Common Status Codes:
        - 200 (OK) - The request was successful.
        - 404 (Not Found) - The requested resource was not found.

2. **POST**
    - The `POST` method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
    - It is often used when submitting form data or when uploading a file.
    - Common Status Codes:
        - 201 (Created) - The resource has been created.
        - 400 (Bad Request) - The request is malformed or invalid.

3. **PUT**
    - The `PUT` method is used to update a current resource with new data.
    - It is idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests will have the same effect as a single request.
    - Common Status Codes:
        - 200 (OK) - The request was successful.
        - 204 (No Content) - The request was successful, and there is no response body.

4. **DELETE**
    - The `DELETE` method is used to request the removal of a resource.
    - It is often used to delete data or resources on the server.
    - Common Status Codes:
        - 200 (OK) - The request was successful.
        - 404 (Not Found) - The resource to be deleted was not found.

5. **PATCH**
    - The `PATCH` method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
    - It is often used to update specific fields of an existing resource.
    - Common Status Codes:
        - 200 (OK) - The request was successful.
        - 422 (Unprocessable Entity) - The request is semantically incorrect.

6. **HEAD**
    - The `HEAD` method is similar to `GET` but only retrieves the headers of the response, not the actual data.
    - Common Status Codes:
        - 200 (OK) - The request was successful.
        - 404 (Not Found) - The requested resource was not found.

7. **OPTIONS**
    - The `OPTIONS` method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
    - It is often used to check what methods and other capabilities the server supports.
    - Common Status Codes:
        - 200 (OK) - The request was successful.
        - 204 (No Content) - The request was successful, and there is no response body.

8. **CONNECT**
    - The `CONNECT` method establishes a network connection to the resource identified by the URI.
    - It is typically used for creating network tunnels to secure resources through an HTTP proxy.

9. **TRACE**
    - The `TRACE` method performs a diagnostic test along the path to the target resource.
    - It is used for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

## Usage Examples

Here are some common use cases for these HTTP methods along with common status codes:

- **GET:** Fetch the details of a product, retrieve a web page, or retrieve user information.
- **POST:** Submit a form, upload a file, or create a new user account.
- **PUT:** Update an existing user's information or replace an entire resource.
- **DELETE:** Delete a user account or remove a specific resource.
- **PATCH:** Update a user's email address, change the title of a blog post, or apply partial updates.
- **HEAD:** Check if a resource exists and retrieve its metadata.
- **OPTIONS:** Find out which methods and headers are allowed for a resource.
- **CONNECT:** Establish a secure network connection through a proxy.
- **TRACE:** Debug and trace the path of a request.

## HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are returned by the server to indicate the result of a request. Here are some common HTTP status codes:

- **1xx (Informational):** The request was received, continuing process.
- **2xx (Successful):** The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
    - 200 (OK): The request was successful.
    - 201 (Created): The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in the creation of a new resource.
    - 204 (No Content): The request was successful, and there is no response body.
- **3xx (Redirection):** Further action is needed to complete the request.
    - 301 (Moved Permanently): The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
    - 302 (Found): The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
- **4xx (Client Error):** The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled by the server.
    - 400 (Bad Request): The request is malformed or invalid.
    - 401 (Unauthorized): Authentication is required, and the user is not authenticated.
    - 403 (Forbidden): The server understood the request but refuses to fulfill it.
    - 404 (Not Found): The requested resource was not found.
    - 422 (Unprocessable Entity): The request is semantically incorrect.
- **5xx (Server Error):** The server failed to fulfill a valid request.
    - 500 (Internal Server Error): A generic error message when no more specific message is suitable.
    - 502 (Bad Gateway): The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server it accessed.
    - 503 (Service Unavailable): The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary over
